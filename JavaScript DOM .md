# JavaScript DOM

JavaScript Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. It provides a way to interact with the page and make it more interactive. The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects, which makes it possible for programming languages to interact with the page.

The DOM is an essential part of making web pages interactive. It is a representation of the HTML, XML, or XHTML document as an object-oriented model. The DOM model represents a document with a logical tree structure, that is, each node in the tree represents a part of the document. This way, developers can access and manipulate different parts of the web page by targeting specific nodes, which makes it possible to add, modify or remove content on the page.

JavaScript can change all the HTML elements in the page, change the HTML attributes, and change the CSS styles. JavaScript can also create new HTML elements and text nodes, remove existing elements and nodes, and replace elements and nodes too. This is why the DOM is an essential part of creating dynamic and interactive web pages.

There are three main parts of the DOM:

1. **Document Object Model:** It represents the complete HTML or XML document. Developers can use the Document Object Model to access and manipulate the entire document.
2. **Element Object Model:** It represents an HTML element. Developers can use the Element Object Model to access and manipulate individual HTML elements on the page.
3. **Attribute Object Model:** It represents an attribute of an HTML element. Developers can use the Attribute Object Model to access and manipulate HTML attributes of an element.
